# odin-recipes 

This project is about recipes, it's intended to make me adapt the lesson I took before to practice them and be better programmer.

Maybe now you're reading this and you don't know what's going on. So I'm currently learning the Odin project curriculum, Its curriculum is mostly text based, it teaches you in the hard way where you'll easily adapt with how the real world programming works and this can make be part of the 1% programmers.

I'm genuinely happy wth TOP (The Odin Project), and how it influenced not only my programming journey but my whole life.
