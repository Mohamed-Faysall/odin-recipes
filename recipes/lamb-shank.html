    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Lamb shank is a cut of meat from the lower leg of a lamb, prized for its rich flavor and succulent texture when slow-cooked. </p>
    <p>The cut is naturally tough due to connective tissue, but this breaks down during long, slow cooking methods  </p>
    <p>like braising,resulting in a tender, melt-in-your-mouth result. </p>
    <p>The bone adds flavor and richness, making it a popular choice for hearty, comforting meals.  </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>4 lamb shanks</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
        <li>1 large onion, sliced</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>⅓ cup saba</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place lamb shanks into a large bowl; drizzle with olive oil. 
            Sprinkle with salt, black pepper, smoked paprika, cinnamon, and rosemary. T
            oss the lamb shanks to spread oil and seasonings over the meat.</li>
        <li>Spread onion slices and garlic cloves into the bottom of a heavy 9x12-inch baking dish. Lay lamb shanks over onions and garlic.</li>
        <li>Bake lamb in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Combine chicken broth and saba in a bowl. Pour mixture over the lamb shanks. 
            Cover baking dish tightly with foil and place baking dish on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake lamb in the oven until a knife pierces the meat easily, 2 1/2 to 3 hours. The meat will be tender but not falling off the bone. 
            Use tongs to turn the shanks over in the pan sauce. Increase temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Return shanks to oven and bake, uncovered, until meat is fork-tender and the sauce has thickened slightly, 10 to 15 minutes. 
            Turn shanks over in the sauce after 10 minutes and check for tenderness; if still not tender enough, 
            return to oven for 10 to 15 more minutes and test again.</li>
        <li>Transfer lamb shanks to a bowl and keep warm. Strain pan juices into a saucepan and place over medium heat. 
            Bring to a boil and cook, stirring often, until thickened, about 5 minutes. 
            Skim any excess grease from top of sauce. Taste and season with salt; stir in fresh rosemary. 
            Serve sauce drizzled over lamb shanks.</li>
    </ol>
